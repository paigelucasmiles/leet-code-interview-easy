// Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

// Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
// Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let i = 0
    
    for(let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if(nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
            i++
            nums[i] = nums[j]
        }
    }
    return i + 1

// 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

// Example 1:
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
// Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

// Example 2:
// Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
// Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

// Example 3:
// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
